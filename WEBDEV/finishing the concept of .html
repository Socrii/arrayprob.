        History
    </h2>
    <b>
        Early Year
    </b>
    <p>
        In 1912, an all-India cricket team visited England for the first time, sponsored and captained by Maharaja of
        Patiala. In 1926, two representatives of the Calcutta Cricket Club travelled to London to attend meetings of the
        Imperial Cricket Conference, the predecessor to the current International Cricket Council. Although technically
        not an official representative of Indian cricket, they were allowed to attend by Lord Harris, chairman of the
        conference. The outcome of the meeting was the MCC's decision to send a team to India, led by Arthur Gilligan,
        who had captained England in The Ashes.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

    BCCI's logo is derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_India_(flag)">
        Star of India</a>'. According to Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu, BCCI's logo was designed by the
    British Raj in 1928. It is 90% similar to Star of India sign.<sup>
